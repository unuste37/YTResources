Setup Jenkins on EC2 and Build load using Jenkins  
#########################################

Task 1: Launch an EC2
=====================
# You may use the below specs. 
# region used: us-east-1 (N Virginia) region. 
# Launch Ubuntu 22.04 LTS t2.micro EC2 machine. 
# Note: In the security group, open ports 22, 80, 8080 and 9999. 
# Use the EC2 Name tag "Jenkins'; Use a key pair


Task 2: Jenkins Installation
============================
# After the EC2 server is up & running, SSH into the machine and do the below:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget unzip -y

sudo apt install awscli -y

aws configure
enter your Access Key 
enter your Secret Access Key
# To test if the config has worked, you can use below aws cli command to list your S3 buckets.
# If the config is not proper, you will get error. Else you will get your S3 bucket list. 
aws s3 ls

# create a small script which will install Jenkins
vi MyJenkins.sh

# Type the below code into MyJenkins.sh

## start of code #####

sudo apt install default-jre -y

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

sudo systemctl start jenkins.service
sudo systemctl status jenkins

echo "InitialAdminPassword"
echo "-------------------"
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

## end of code ####

#Save & quit


# Provide execute permission
chmod +x MyJenkins.sh

# execute the shell script to launch Jenkins
./MyJenkins.sh

# Type 'Q' to get back prompt

# Exit & SSH into the machine again. New hostname will appear now

jenkins --version

# Use below command to find ip address of the Jenkins server
curl ifconfig.me

# Check if Jenkins landing page is appearing: 
http://18.234.238.69:8080/ # Use your respective ip address


Task 3: Configure Jenkins
=========================
# Get the initial password for Jenkins from the corresponding folder in Jenkins server.
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
# copy the password. 
ex: e606c92ebb3b430ca5c2e480f5257e1f

# Now, go to the browser and enter Jenkins URL
http://54.82.104.49:8080/

# Under Unlock Jenkins, enter the above Initial password. Continue.
Click on Install suggested Plugins on Customize Jenkins page.

# Once the plugins are installed, it gives you the page where you can create new admin user id 
# and password. 

Enter user id and password. Save & Continue. 
# To keep things simple, choose a simple user id and password. For ex: admin; admin
# Needless to say, in real life, you must keep the user ids and passwords separate.

In next step, on Instance Configuration Page, verify your Jenkins Public IP and Port Number then 
click on Save and Finish

Start Using Jenkins

# You will be prompted to the Jenkins Home Page

Click on Manage Jenkins > Plugins

Click on Available Plugins. Search for 'Maven'. Select 2 plugins as listed below:
 - Maven Integration Plugin 
and click 'Install'

Once the installation is completed,  Go back to 'Manage Jenkins'. 

Click on 'Tools'

Inside Tools, look for Maven Installations and click Add Maven. 
Give the Name as Maven-yourname, choose Version as 3.9.6 (or latest) and Click 'Save'.


Task 4: Setup GitHub repository
===============================

Create your Github account
Fork the following repository and create your own repository 'jenkins-proj'.
Repository: https://github.com/unuste37/YT-Jenkins


Task 5: Create a build project
==============================
Now you need to make a project for your application build. For that, select 'New Item' from the 
Home Page of Jenkins.

Enter an item name as 'jenkins-proj' and select the project as Maven Project and then click OK.

After you click on OK, you will be prompted to the configure page inside 'jenkins-proj' project. 
Go to Source Code Management tab, select Source Code Management as Git. You need to provide the 
GitHub Repository URL and GitHub Account Credentials. In the Credentials field, you have to 
click Add. Then click on Jenkins. 

Then you will get prompted for Jenkins Credentials Provider page of Jenkins. Under Add Credentials, 
you can add your GitHub Username, Password and Description. Then click on Add.

After returning to the Source Code Management Page, click on Credentials and Choose your 
GitHub Credentials.

Keep all the other values as default and select Build menu on the left side.
Inside Goals and options add 'clean package' and save the configuration by clicking on Save.

# 'clean package' (all small letters) command clears the target directory and Builds the project and 
# packages the resulting JAR file into the target directory. 

Get back to Maven project 'jenkins-proj'. Click on 'Build Now' for building the .war file 
for your application.

# You can go to Workspace > dist folder to see that the .war file is created there.
# war file will be created in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/jenkins-proj/target/


Task 6: Install and Configure Tomcat for Deploying our Application on Jenkins server
====================================================================================

sudo apt install tomcat9 tomcat9-admin -y

sudo systemctl enable tomcat9

# Now we need to navigate to server.xml to change the Tomcat port number from 8080 to 9999, 
# as port number 8080 is already being used by Jenkins website.
sudo vi /etc/tomcat9/server.xml
#Change 8080 to 9999 in 1 place. (line 69 / red color font) 

#Now restart the system for the changes to take effect
sudo service tomcat9 restart
sudo service tomcat9 status

# We need to copy the .war file created in the previous Jenkins build from Jenkins workspace 
# to tomcat webapps directory to serve the web content

sudo cp -R /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/jenkins-proj/target/welcome-page-war-1.0.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps

# Once this is done, go to your browser and enter Jenkins Server Public IP address followed 
# by port 9999 and path 'welcome-page-war-1.0' and you can see tomcat is now serving your web page
# (URL:  http://< Your Jenkins Public IP >:9999/welcome-page-war-1.0/)
http://18.234.238.69:9999/welcome-page-war-1.0/

# You will see a simple html page which says "Welcome! We are learning DevOps!!"


Task 7: Clean Up
================

# Terminate the EC2; You may also delete any security group you created.

# In case if you are continuing to use Jenkins, it is better to remove the tomcat server.
# Else it may slow down Jenkins
sudo service tomcat9 stop
sudo apt remove tomcat9
